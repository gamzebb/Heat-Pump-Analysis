## Heat Pump Deployment Priority Analysis – England

The UK Government asked for analysis of England’s housing stock to see where heat pumps should be deployed first and how subsidy funding could be targeted.Using EPC data from 324 local authorities, we ranked areas based on four factors: Cost-effectiveness (value for money), Social equity (helping fuel-poor households), Carbon reduction potential, and Market readiness. Our results show that different regions need different approaches. The findings provide practical recommendations on how to focus limited funding for the biggest social and environmental benefit, while supporting net zero goals and reducing fuel poverty.

## Data and reproducibility

This repo contains all analysis code in the notebooks/ folder.
The raw EPC extracts and the derived files certificates_filtered.pkl and recommendations_filtered.pkl are very large, so they are not versioned in GitHub (pushes/timeouts on my machine with limited RAM).
Because of this, the repo is not fully “run-from-scratch” without the data.
